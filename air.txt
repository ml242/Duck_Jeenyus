Air (Day Version)

Air

There is a space where you used to sit
We'd watch the East River get all lit up like us
Oh yes, it felt so glamorous
To know that our blood was toxic

Like words we used to say just to keep each other warm
In the false sense of cold cause the AC was on
But I couldn't get up
And your chivalry didn't extend past the bed that we lived in that month

Cause I don't wanna wait 'til your hands go numb
Beatin' on your chest with my fist
Just so you can breathe the air, the air
Oh oh oh you make me scared

There is a hole that I used to fill
With bruises buried in the valley of my arms
I knew that it would work until
My mind like my blood was toxic

Like words we used to say just to make each other hurt
In the false sense of worth 'cause synapses were on
But I couldn't get out
And your chivalry didn't extend past the end of a very brief love

Cause I don't wanna wait 'til your hands go numb
Beatin' on your chest with my fist
Just so you can breathe the air, the air
Oh oh oh you make me scared

You moved along I settled down I settled down
You moved along I settled down I settled down
You moved along I settled down I settled down
You moved along I settled down I settled down

Cause I don't wanna wait 'til your hands go numb
Beatin' on your chest with my fist
Just so you can breathe the air, the air
Oh oh oh you make me scared
