U Turn Me Up

Here's the dark it's getting late
I took a vow that I'd never be afraid
I take your hand
You're a stranger but I'm certain that you're hurting to make an escape
So am I, I've gotten bored
I'm ready to walk in the light of the world
With breaks for tea, our dirty feet
We left our sneakers by the sea

'Cause I like pretty things
Every sunrise summer brings
How the world seems from the clouds
Your eyes when you're coming down
I like pretty things
Every sunset summer brings
How the world looks from the ground
Your eyes when you're coming down

You turn me up
You turn me up
You turn me up
I wanna see just how high I can go
You turn me up
You turn me up
You turn me up
I wanna see just how high I can go

Here's New York it's gotten old
You're an embrace in the cold
A shot of life when I am weak
Ambien when I can't sleep
You said sometimes you can't be found
I shook my head cause I never settle down
The clouds in the sky might provide more support than just hoping that I'll stick around

'Cause I like pretty things
Every sunrise summer brings
How the world seems from the clouds
Your eyes when you're coming down
I like pretty things
Every sunset summer brings
How the world looks from the ground
Your eyes when you come

You turn me up
You turn me up
You turn me up
I wanna see just how high I can go
You turn me up
You turn me up
You turn me up
I wanna see just how high I can go
