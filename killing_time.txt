Killing Time/Your Ever After

I will wait, I will wait, I will wait, I will wait, I will wait
I will wait 'til your love comes back again
I will wait, I will wait
With my heart hardly broken
Until you admit that the words we had spoken were said
My friend

I will wait, I will wait, I will wait, I will wait, I will wait
I will wait 'till this high comes back again
I don't want this time to end
But I will wait I will wait I will wait I will wait
I will wait I will wait I will wait for you my friend

Til we realign
I am killing time
Killing time
You stay on my mind
And I am killing time
Killing time

Tell me you need me 
I'll read you the unabridged works of John Keats if you just come home again
If you just come home again
But tell me you need me for now and completely and I will wait for you my friend

Til we realign
I am killing time
Killing time
You stay on my mind
And I am killing time
Killing time

Beep boop
Oh, say
I will wait for you
And I'll stare at these clocks
'Til you come home
I will not forget you though I'm all alone
And I will wait for you til you come home
And I will not forget you
Because I am not alone
I'm just killing time
I'm just killing time
I'm just killing time
